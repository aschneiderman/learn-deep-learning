Currently,  this site is a collection of my notes as I begin to learn about Deep Learning, beginning with the fabulous [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s course, [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).

As I get a basic handle on Deep Learning, this site may turn into a pilot project for doing a tiny bit to [smooth the learning curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html).

{ NOTE: right now, a lot of this is a notes dump from the lesson notebooks by fastai; all the quotes are in block quote form, but I haven't done links to them because I'm not sure which if any I will keep. Once I am beginning to summarize, etc., need to go back and get the links}
