## Prepping the Data

Before we train, we turn our data into a form the computer can rock out on.

For ex: we want to look at an image and figure out what digit it is, such as an 8
Since computers don't have eyeballs and really like numbers, we turn the image into an 18 x 18 matrix of pixels, where 0 = white, 255 = black, everything in between is a shade of white/black/gray. 

## Training the Model

[Overview](../pages/workflow/training-overview.html)

Things we need to tweak our model about:
- [Overfitting](../pages/vocab/over-under-fitting.html) and [Underfitting](../pages/vocab/over-under-fitting.html)

The [Math behind Training the Model](../pages/workflow/math-deep-learning.html)
